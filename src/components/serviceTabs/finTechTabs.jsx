                To reduce the current turn around time of certification and providing adequate information and case studies about 15CB certificates, we have created a web solution which uses machine learning to provide the certificate and dashboard. The solution reduces the lengthy process of getting information for a single certificate from multiple websites to a single repository for the client. The repository holds all certificates for a period of 7 years which enables future learnings and aids in assessments if any.
